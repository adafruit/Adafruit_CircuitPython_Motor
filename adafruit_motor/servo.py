====================================================

Servos are motor based actuators that incorporate a feedback loop into the design. These feedback
loops enable pulse width modulated control to determine position or rotational speed.

       The specified pulse width range of a servo has historically been 1000-2000us,
       for a 90 degree range of motion. But nearly all modern servos have a 170-180
       degree range, and the pulse widths can go well out of the range to achieve this
       extended motion. The default values here of ``750`` and ``2250`` typically give
       135 degrees of motion. You can set ``actuation_range`` to correspond to the
       actual range of motion you observe with your given ``min_pulse`` and ``max_pulse``
       values.

       .. warning:: You can extend the pulse width above and below these limits to
         get a wider range of movement. But if you go too low or too high,
         the servo mechanism may hit the end stops, buzz, and draw extra current as it stalls.
         Test carefully to find the safe minimum and maximum.
